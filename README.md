As titanic is a well known dataset used for education purposes. This repository contain the code for preprocessing and applying machine learning techniques to predict the passenger survival accuracy.

In this project i am only dealing with train and test file just to give my perspective on dealing with the new dataset.

Libraries you need are
- Numpy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

you only need to give the path of you train file to the dataframe and it is ready to move further. After doing some preprocessing steps the newly processed dataframe is converted in .csv file which help us in future to apply machine learning models.
More cleaned dataset means good accuracy outputs.
